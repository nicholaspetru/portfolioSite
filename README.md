Please note: I no longer update/maintain this site. I've since started from scratch on a website in my personal-website repository. It will soon be available on nickpetru.com. Thanks! (6/19/17)

## Nick Petru's first Website

My first webstie! It started off as a [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) template. So far it is simply a resume. Soon it will be a portfolio and more. And later on I'll probably redo it and start from scratch... Still brand new/very raw. Feedback welcome.

Thanks!
